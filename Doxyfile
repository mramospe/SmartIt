# The EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS tag can be used to specify one or more symbol names
# (namespaces, classes, functions, etc.) that should be excluded from the
# output. The symbol name can be a fully qualified name, a word, or if the
# wildcard * is used, a substring. Examples: ANamespace, AClass,
# AClass::ANamespace, ANamespace::*Test
#
# Note that the wildcards are matched against the file with absolute path, so to
# exclude all test directories use the pattern */test/*

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

# Set the SHOW_NAMESPACES tag to NO to disable the generation of the Namespaces
# page. This will remove the Namespaces entry from the Quick Index and from the
# Folder Tree View (if specified).
# The default value is: YES.
